# Project 0
A Java console based CLI (command-line interface) or server (HTTP or other protocol) program centered around the transport and transformation of data from one or more sources to others.

## Suggested features
- Command-line flags, arguments, or subcommands
- File-based configuration, data persistence, or logging
- Public web API integration
- SQL database

Programs should start simple and features should be added constantly. Focus on a quickly built prototype, don't worry about architecture or best practices just yet. Once the program is working and feasible as intended, refactor for readibility and maintainibility.
